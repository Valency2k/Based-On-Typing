🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Based on Typing
========================================

This guide will help you deploy your smart contract to Base network.

========================================
OPTION 1: Deploy to Base Sepolia (TESTNET - RECOMMENDED FOR TESTING)
========================================

📍 Step 1: Get Test ETH
------------------------
1. Go to Base Sepolia Faucet: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Request testnet ETH (it's free!)
4. Wait for the testnet ETH to arrive in your wallet

📍 Step 2: Setup Environment Variables
---------------------------------------
1. Copy .env.example to .env:
   - Right-click .env.example → Copy
   - Paste in the same folder → Rename to .env

2. Open .env file and add your private key:
   - Open MetaMask
   - Click the 3 dots → Account Details → Export Private Key
   - Enter your password → Copy the key
   - Paste it in .env (remove "0x" prefix if present)
   
   Example:
   PRIVATE_KEY=abc123def456... (your actual key)

📍 Step 3: Update ETH Price (IMPORTANT!)
-----------------------------------------
1. Check current ETH price: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum
   
2. Open: scripts/deploy.js

3. Find line 9:
   const INITIAL_ETH_PRICE_IN_CENTS = 300000;
   
4. Update with current price in cents:
   - If ETH = $2,500.00 → set 250000
   - If ETH = $3,000.00 → set 300000
   - If ETH = $3,500.00 → set 350000

📍 Step 4: Compile the Contract
--------------------------------
Run in terminal:

npm run compile

Wait for "Compiled successfully!" message.

📍 Step 5: Deploy to Base Sepolia Testnet
------------------------------------------
Run in terminal:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network baseSepolia

📍 Step 6: Copy Contract Address
---------------------------------
The deployment script will show:

✅ BasedOnTyping deployed to: 0xABC123...

COPY THIS ADDRESS! You'll need it in the next step.

📍 Step 7: Update Frontend Configuration
-----------------------------------------
1. Open: web3Integration.js

2. Find line 18:
   contractAddress: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',

3. Replace with your deployed address:
   contractAddress: '0xABC123...', (your actual address from step 6)

4. Find line 60:
   activeNetwork: 'testnet'
   
   Make sure it says 'testnet' for Base Sepolia

5. Save the file

📍 Step 8: Test Your Game!
---------------------------
1. Refresh your browser (F5 or Ctrl+R)

2. Make sure MetaMask is connected to "Base Sepolia" network

3. Click "Connect Wallet"

4. Try playing a game mode - it should ask for payment!

5. Approve the transaction in MetaMask

6. Start typing! 🎮

========================================
OPTION 2: Deploy to Base Mainnet (PRODUCTION - REAL MONEY)
========================================

⚠️ WARNING: This uses REAL ETH and costs real money!

Follow the same steps as Option 1, but:

1. Make sure you have REAL ETH in your wallet (not test ETH)
   - You need ~0.001-0.002 ETH for deployment gas fees

2. In Step 5, use this command instead:
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base

3. In Step 7, change activeNetwork to 'mainnet':
   activeNetwork: 'mainnet'

4. Make sure MetaMask is on "Base" network (not Base Sepolia)

========================================
📝 AFTER DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
========================================

✅ Contract deployed successfully
✅ Contract address copied
✅ web3Integration.js updated with contract address
✅ activeNetwork set correctly (testnet or mainnet)
✅ Browser refreshed
✅ MetaMask on correct network
✅ Wallet connected
✅ Game is playable with blockchain payments

========================================
🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

❌ "Insufficient funds" error
→ You need more ETH in your wallet for gas fees

❌ "Invalid private key" error
→ Check your .env file - make sure private key has no spaces or "0x" prefix

❌ "Network not supported" error
→ Make sure MetaMask is on Base Sepolia (testnet) or Base (mainnet)

❌ "Contract not found" error
→ Double-check the contract address in web3Integration.js

❌ Game fee shows as "Error"
→ Contract address
